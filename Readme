1.carve the appropriate spline from the BMG by ovito (Affine transformation to (0, 0), slice (1 0 0, 720), slice (0 1 0, 180) and output data.spline1)
2.use the code to make NG within the carved spline
3.modified the input.txt
5.compile the gfortran code (the code should include ggP12.f90, datatypes.mod and variables.mod): gfortran ggP12.f90 -o columnar
6.run the code: ./columnar
7.keep the atom type (nc.xyz) and the grain ID (output.plt) for each atom
8.repeat the steps 1-6 and obtain another spline
9.merge all the splines and then get the NG
